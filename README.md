# pythonWebCrawler
a python webcrawler, that returns all the links along with a title from an amazon products page.

This is a program I made when I was around 15 years  old in Highschool. I came back and revisited it and made it compatible for amazon
book section. To use it, change the url variable in crawler.py to the url you wish to use. As an example I have used amazon book products.
